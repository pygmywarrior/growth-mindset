    <p class="author__desc">I am a professor of psychology and social behavior at Stanford University and I challenge myself to grow and to make mistakes. But it wasn't always this way. 
        <br><br>Back at high school I was afraid not to disappoint my parents. They had high expectations of me.
        The pressure was unbearable and I couldn't be truly myself because I was hiding behind the mask of intelligence and talent.
        When went to college to become laywer, as my parents wanted me to, I had to stop it somehow. 
        <br><br>That's when realized one thing that completely changed my life.
        I developed a new attitude towards goals and failures. I called this idea <i>Growth Mindset</i> in opposition to <i>Fixed Mindset</i> I had before.
        <br><br>And that's what this book about. It's designed to help you adopt new mindset and become a fulfilled human being that grows every day and see everywhere occasion to learn.
